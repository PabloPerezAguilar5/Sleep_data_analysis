# Sleep Data Analysis

This project uses Python to analyze sleep data collected from a CSV file. The data includes information on sleep duration and electronic device usage before bedtime. The goal is to explore and visualize these data to extract insights into sleep habits and possible influencing factors.

## Features

1. **Data Loading**: Load sleep data from a CSV file that contains information on sleep duration and electronic device usage.
   
2. **Statistical Analysis**:
    - Calculate descriptive statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of sleep duration.
    - Compare electronic device usage with sleep duration.
   
3. **Data Visualization**: 
    - Scatter plots showing the relationship between device usage and sleep duration.
    - Histograms of sleep duration.

4. **Data Cleaning**: 
    - Handle missing values and outliers.
    - Data type conversions and normalization if necessary.
